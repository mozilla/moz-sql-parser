            "SQL is a familiar language used to access databases. Although, each database vendor has its quirky implementation, there is enough standardization that the average developer does not need to know of those quirks. This familiar core SQL (lowest common denominator, if you will) is useful enough to explore data in primitive ways. It is hoped that, once programmers have reviewed a datastore with basic SQL queries, and they see the value of that data, and they will be motivated to use the datastore's native query format.",
